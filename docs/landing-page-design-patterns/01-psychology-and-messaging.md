# 01 — Psychology & Messaging

## The Three-Second Rule
Visitors decide to stay or leave within **3 seconds**. Every above-the-fold element must answer:
1. **What is this?** — product/service name + category
2. **What's in it for me?** — specific, measurable benefit
3. **What do I do next?** — one unmistakable CTA

## Headline Formulas That Convert

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `[Outcome] without [Pain]` | "Ship faster without the chaos" |
| `The [Adj] way to [Outcome]` | "The smarter way to manage projects" |
| `[Result] in [Timeframe]` | "Full sales pipeline in 30 days" |
| `Stop [Pain]. Start [Benefit].` | "Stop juggling spreadsheets. Start shipping." |
| `[Number] [Audience] trust us to [Outcome]` | "12,000 teams trust FlowSync to ship on time" |

**Rules:**
- Headline should be ≤ 10 words
- Lead with the **benefit**, not the feature
- Use "you/your" — not "we/our"
- Avoid adjectives like "innovative," "leading," "revolutionary"

## CTA Copy That Works

**High-converting CTA patterns:**
- `Get [Specific Thing] Free` → e.g., "Get My Free Quote"
- `Start [Doing Outcome]` → e.g., "Start Shipping Faster"
- `See [Product] in Action` → demo invitation
- `Join [Number]+ [Group]` → social proof embedded

**Avoid:** "Submit," "Learn More," "Click Here," "Get Started" (too vague)

**CTA Rules:**
- One primary CTA per page (never two equal-weight buttons above the fold)
- Primary CTA: high-contrast, filled background
- Secondary CTA: ghost/outline only
- Repeat primary CTA at every major section break

## Pain-Point Framing (Agitate → Solve)

Structure copy as: **Pain → Agitate → Solve (PAS)**

1. **Pain:** Name the exact frustration the reader has today
2. **Agitate:** Show cost of inaction (time, money, stress, embarrassment)
3. **Solve:** Present your product as the natural exit

Example (SaaS):
> "Your team misses deadlines. Projects fall between the cracks. Clients are frustrated — and so are you. FlowSync gives every task an owner, a deadline, and a real-time status. No more guessing."

## Urgency & Scarcity Triggers

Use **real** urgency — never fabricate:
- Limited spots: "Only 3 enrollment spots left this quarter"
- Time-based: "Free setup ends Friday"
- Social: "47 people viewed this plan today"
- Loss framing: "Every week without [product] costs you $X"

---

## Microcopy & Trust Phrases

Place these **directly below** CTA buttons:
- "No credit card required"
- "Cancel anytime"
- "Free for 14 days"
- "Joins 12,000+ teams"
- "Setup in under 5 minutes"
- "GDPR compliant · SOC 2 certified"

## Section-by-Section Messaging Flow

```
Hero          → What + Who + CTA
Social Strip  → "Trusted by X"
Problem       → Pain point (before state)
Solution      → How it works (3 steps max)
Benefits      → Feature → Benefit mapping
Social Proof  → Reviews + logos + stats
CTA Section   → Final ask with de-risk copy
Footer        → SEO links + legal
```
