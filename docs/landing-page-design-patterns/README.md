## The Three-Second Rule

A visitor decides whether to stay or leave **within 3 seconds**. Every above-the-fold decision must answer:

1. **What is this?** — Clear product/service name and category
2. **What's in it for me?** — Specific, concrete benefit (not feature)
3. **What do I do next?** — One unmistakable CTA

## The Universal "Must-Haves" (No Exceptions)

- [ ] **One hero headline** — specific benefit, not generic tagline
- [ ] **One primary CTA** — above the fold, high contrast color
- [ ] **Trust signal** — directly below or adjacent to CTA
- [ ] **Zero navigation clutter** — remove header links that lead off-page
- [ ] **Mobile-first** — design for thumb reach, not mouse
- [ ] **Page speed < 3s** — every extra second costs ~7% conversions
- [ ] **Social proof visible within first scroll** — logos, star rating, or count
